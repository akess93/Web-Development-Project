# Web-Development-Project
This is a re-design and implementation project of a company website.
This is my first website created from scratch within notepad++ in the course web development introduction at Lule√•s Technical University.
I have used mainly HTML and CSS and a few lines of javascript.
For the layout I have used flexbox. 
This project are not responsive for the moment and this is the next step in my learning curve within web development.
